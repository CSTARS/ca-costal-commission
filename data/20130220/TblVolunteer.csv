If you have more questions, or want to get involved before our next meeting, volunteers can contact us at info@surfridersd.org or call (858) 792-9940.
We Need Volunteers to Help With:

Informational Booth Staffing:
Help us staff our booth at special events and outdoor fairs. Educate the public about environmental problems and solutions and help distribute information.

Beach Cleanups:
Assist with our bi-monthly beach cleanups on the fourth Sunday of each month. Every month we choose a different beach or street to cleanup. Volunteers are always needed at these events, and it is a good event for families too. If you would like to coordinate a clean-up at your favorite beach, or just come out and help at one that is already planned that would be great!!

Administrative Assistant:
Provide office support by answering phones, working on our database, filing and doing a variety of office tasks.

Graphic Design:
We need volunteers to help us with our newsletter layout and creating new brochures and event materials.

Events:
If you know of an event coming up in your community that we might like to participate in or have an idea for a new event, please let us know. We are always looking for new ways to recruit volunteers and get information out into the community.

Newsletter:
We are always looking for new issues and topics to include in our newsletter. If you would like to submit an article to our newsletter editor, please send it to info@surfridersd.org. Make sure to include your name and contact information so that we may contact you.

Legal Issues:
We are constantly involved in many different legal projects. Unfortunately, because of the hectic pace, we don't do a lot of ""coordinating"" in the normal volunteer coordinating sense. Often, those who get involved on the legal and policy end of things do so because they have the time during the day to go to meetings of city councils, regional water boards, or other agency gatherings regarding the issues the individual is interested in. There are a million issues going on at all times, so if you have the time and commitment, there's almost always something to do. If you want to know more, feel free to contact us for more information.

Campaigns/Programs:
The Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter is currently engaged in the following campaigns: Rise Above Plastics, Hold On To Your Butt, No Border Sewage and Beach Preservation.
