<h2>HOW TO USE THE CREEKS TO COAST DIRECTORY</h2>

<div class="well">
	The Creeks to Coast Directory is a tool for learning about organizations in California that address marine, 
	coastal, and watershed topics. The California Coastal Commission provides this directory as a service to 
	the public for research, to find educational programs and resources, or to connect to volunteer and 
	internship opportunities in our state.
</div>


<h3>SEARCHING THE DIRECTORY</h3>

<div>You can search for organizations by the following categories:</div>

<ul>
  <li>County where the organization's office is located</li>
  <li>County where the organization does its activities and programs (Many organizations work in or serve multiple counties, sometimes different from where their office is located.)</li>
  <li>Topic the organization works on</li>
  <li>Type of educational resource offered</li>
  <li>Target audience</li>
  <li>Organizations that offer volunteer or internship opportunities, and non-English resources.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin:20px;">
	To begin your search, click <a href="http://www.coastal.ca.gov/publiced/creekstocoast/index.html#search">Start Search</a> 
	or select a category directly from the <a href="http://www.coastal.ca.gov/publiced/creekstocoast/index.html">home page</a>. 
	Click on a category to expand it. You can also view a list of all the organizations by clicking 
	<a href="http://www.coastal.ca.gov/publiced/creekstocoast/index.html#all">See All</a>.
</div>

<div style="margin:20px;">
	Once on the <a href="http://www.coastal.ca.gov/publiced/testdirectory.html#search">Search Results</a> page, you can 
	further narrow your search by selecting from the categories in the box on the left, under "Narrow Your Search."  Click on 
	a category to expand it. The search categories you've selected appear above the search results in blue boxes. To remove 
	a category from your search, click on its blue box. The blue box will disappear and your search results will expand. 
</div>

<div style="margin:20px;">
	You may also narrow your search by typing in a keyword and clicking Search by Keyword, found at the top left of the 
	<a href="http://www.coastal.ca.gov/publiced/testdirectory.html#search">Search Results</a> page. You can type a single 
	word or several words (to find all organization records that include any of those words), or surround a phrase with 
	quotation marks (to find only instances with that exact wording). 
</div>

<div style="margin:20px;">
	Search results will contain a list of organizations' names, their physical and internet addresses, and the first few lines 
	from their mission statement. Click on an organization to read more about them and what they offer. 
</div>



<h3>EDITING THE DIRECTORY</h3>

<div style="margin:20px;">
	If you represent an organization or see an error in an entry, click on the Edit Record button at the bottom of the organization's 
	page to submit your suggested changes. Suggestions will be reviewed for approval by California Coastal Commission staff before 
	being finalized. 
</div>

<h3>ADDING TO THE DIRECTORY</h3>

<div style="margin:20px;">
	Organizations are encouraged to <a href="http://www.coastal.ca.gov/publiced/testdirectory.html#edit">submit information for inclusion</a> 
	in the Creeks to Coast Directory. Submissions will be reviewed for approval by California Coastal Commission staff before 
	being added to the Directory. Inclusion in the Directory does not indicate Coastal Commission support of the policies or 
	programs of the organizations. To be included, organizations must be not for profit; address marine, coastal, watershed, 
	and/or water issues within California; and their mission and activities should not be in conflict with the mission of the 
	California Coastal Commission, which is to "protect and enhance California's coast and ocean for present and future generations."
</div>
